AXIOMATIC SYSTEM GENERATOR
Concept: Group
==================================================

AXIOMATIC SYSTEM: Axioms for group
========================================

Axiom 1: Closure: For all a,b in G, a*b is in G
          Formal: ∀a,b ∈ G: a∗b ∈ G
Axiom 2: Associativity: (a*b)*c = a*(b*c)
          Formal: ∀a,b,c ∈ G: (a∗b)∗c = a∗(b∗c)
Axiom 3: Identity: There exists e such that e*a = a*e = a
          Formal: ∃e ∈ G, ∀a ∈ G: e∗a = a∗e = a
Axiom 4: Inverse: For each a, there exists a^(-1) such that a*a^(-1) = e
          Formal: ∀a ∈ G, ∃a⁻¹ ∈ G: a∗a⁻¹ = e

\section{Core Theorems and Proof Attempts}

AUTOMATED PROOF GENERATION
Theorem: Sum of two even integers is even

Formal Statement: For all a,b in Z, (even(a) AND even(b)) IMPLIES even(a + b)

Proof by Definition:
1. Let a and b be even integers
2. By definition, there exists k1 in Z: a = 2*k1
3. By definition, there exists k2 in Z: b = 2*k2
4. Therefore: a + b = 2*k1 + 2*k2 = 2*(k1 + k2)
5. Since k1 + k2 is in Z, we have a + b = 2*k where k = k1 + k2
6. By definition, a + b is even
7. QED (Quod Erat Demonstrandum)

Proof Status: COMPLETE
Verification: PASSED

Recommendation: Try breaking down into smaller lemmas


AUTOMATED PROOF GENERATION
Theorem: If a and b are even, then a*b is even

Formal Statement: For all a,b in Z, (even(a) AND even(b)) IMPLIES even(a + b)

1. Let a and b be even integers
2. By definition, there exists k1 in Z: a = 2*k1
3. By definition, there exists k2 in Z: b = 2*k2
4. Therefore: a + b = 2*k1 + 2*k2 = 2*(k1 + k2)
5. Since k1 + k2 is in Z, we have a + b = 2*k where k = k1 + k2
6. By definition, a + b is even

1. Let a and b be even integers
2. By definition, there exists k1 in Z: a = 2*k1

\forall a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\, (\text{even}(a) \wedge \text{even}(b)) \Rightarrow \text{even}(a+b) \
x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1) \
(\text{even}(a) \wedge \text{even}(b)) \Rightarrow \text{even}(ab) \
(\text{odd}(a) \wedge \text{odd}(b)) \Rightarrow \text{even}(a+b)
